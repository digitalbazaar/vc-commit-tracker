# @digitalbazaar/vc-commit-tracker

> `@digitalbazaar/vc-commit-tracker` retrieves the most recent commit dates from
> a list of public VC specs and test suites on Github and displays them within
> a table in the README.

## GitHub Workflow

The configured GitHub workflow runs at 10 AM UTC every Sunday, refreshing the
`README.md` file. You can also manually run the workflow on main branch.

## Install

Requires:
- Node.js 20+

To install locally (for development):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/digitalbazaar/vc-commit-tracker.git
cd vc-commit-tracker
npm install
```
To update the README with the most recent commit dates for VC specifications
and test suite repositories:

```bash
GH_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_GH_ACCESS_TOKEN" npm run update-readme
```
Note: GitHub imposes restrictions on the number of REST API requests
within a given timeframe. To bypass these limitations, authentication via a
GitHub access token is necessary. Ensure you pass this access token through an
environment variable when executing the script to generate the table.

## Latest Commit Dates by Repository
